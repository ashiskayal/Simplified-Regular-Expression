# Simplified-Regular-Expression
This code takes input of a simplified regular expression [example, if expression is   3+(-5)   then the input should be   3-5   no space and no brackets) and makes a tree to execute the expression. It can hadle floating point numbers. Expression format is  [[0-9]*\.?[0-9]*[+*/-][0-9]*\.?[0-9]*]+

To get the codes go to
  src -> here you will got three files ExpressionTree.java, Main.java, Node.java
  
  Main.java contains the main method.
  Node.java class is for every node of the tree which will be created using the expression.
  ExpressionTree.java class reads each character by character in the expression and does its job.
  ExpressionTree.java prints the created tree in preorder traversal.
  
  If got something wrong, then knock me.
  Thank You :)
